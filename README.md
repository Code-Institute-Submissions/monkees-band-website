## UX
I selected black as the theme color of the website because according to Neil Patel (co-founder of Neil Patel Digital) on his blog on psychology of color he higlighted that "Black adds a sense of luxury and value"  and also quoting an article which says black is the color of “timeless, classic”. I wanted to give a feel of luxury and timelessness to the webite and you colors like yellow, gold and orange to give a mix of excitement and attention to the important information or the buttons to buy. The website give the fans an opportunity to get involved with the option to Join the Fanclub and login if they are already members. Instead of having a home page, then tours page and news page i decided to have all these important features on the same page. This was meant to make the home page informative at first glance and it was also meant limit the number of pages that were going to be on the website. I didn't want the users to have too many pages to go through and end up boring them or making the user lose interest. I put a hovering effect on the first  back ground photo to give users a wow experience when the mouse hovers over the picture or  the booking button. As a user i wouldn't want a website that gives information and get me involved as a fan as well which i think both these matter have been addressed through the sign up for newsletter and joining the fan club. More over the shop caters for all the purchases the user/fans may want from merchandise, downloading and music ordering.

i used this mock up plat form to draw my first plan but i discovered it was eating up most of my time, also the number of pages that i had drawn up were to many given the parameters given in the assignment and had a change of mind on the set up i wanted. So i ended up drawing up diagram some sketchy diagrams that gave me and direction on what i was creating.

## Features

###### Existing Features
Feature 1 - I copied a inverse navbar from getbootstrap.com which i twirked a little bit  to put a Band Logo image.
Feature 2 - On the website users/fan will have an opportunity to join the fanclub by clicking the join the fanclub button. I also put the login button for fans who are already members of the fan club. Both buttons a modal forms which i learned in this coarse. I edited the form to fit to make it easy for fans to sign up and login.
Feature 3 - the main image has a zoom out effect to give fans a special feel on the new promotion of the band perfoming at weddings
Feature 4 - I made sure that all the news and tours are on the same page as this keep the fan informed  about upcoming events and news without having to go through many pages
Feature 5 - On the footer we tr kept it simple and clean. I returned the wedding booking button on the footer to give the fans and future customer license to go through all the pages and have the oppotunity to book for the wedding on what ever page they can be. This also would give the client(Monkees Band) to be able to get more chances to get wedding booking. Also had social media links that open on a separate page so that we don't throw our trafic off-course 
Feature 6 - There is also the a page dedicated to monkees music and albums were fans can listen to the band's music on the click of a button
Feature 7 - There is a page dedicated to the band were the fans get to read and know more about the bandmembers a click on the band members name directs fans to a seperate wikipedia page that has more information abot the specified band memeber
Feature 8 - The media page is were the fans access the band latest photos and videos. the video are embeded for youtube link and also there is a Carousel which fans wiil use to flip through the pictures
FeatThe 9 - The Shop as the name says it all is the money spinner for the band were they will sell merchandise and music hard copies or through downloads. there is a button to buy hard copies and the dowload button also will eneble customers to buy with their credit cards

###### Features Left to Implement

Addition now features would be adding a maps to direct fans to where the shows will be.
Also to have 3 tiers of memberships which will give different benefits to the fans depending on the level tier they are.
We also hope to develop and app for the fans to access all the band material and give the and exlusive insight in the band.


## Technologies Used

On the project i used bootstrap to structure the website columns and make it fully responsive.
I also used font-awesome to give some nice decorations when necessary, i used bootstrap Carousel for photo navigation ,also modals forms for the login and Joinfanclub button and also javascript for the music on click music button

### Testing

this project was tested at every stage of making  and after fixing bugs such as the page not rendering the social media links
the two bugs that remain outstanding are the gap created on the home page by the under main background picture. The gap is move visible on the mobile screens though it might not be picked by many.
the second bug is the Carousel which renders image from the top of the Carousel. Other than these mention bugs the website responsive all screen sizes.

Deployment
this project was done in cloud9 ide and deployed with a terminal using git to push the codes to github.
In my github repository it show a trace of 5 diffent commits and they could have been more because most of the commits were done as update changes. My mentor highlighted to me the importance specifying the what the commit is all about so i believe there will be a different approach to futite projects.
